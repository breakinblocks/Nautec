# <Color id="light_purple">Deep Sea Drain</Color>

<Column alignItems="center" fullWidth={true}>
  <ItemImage id="deep_sea_drain" scale="2"/>
  A 3x3 multiblock that pumps Salt Water out of the ocean.
</Column>

## <Color id="gold">Building It</Color>

Lay a flat 3x3: the Deep Sea Drain in the middle and eight Deep Sea Drain Walls around it. Right-click the Deep Sea Drain with an <ItemLink id="aquarine_steel_wrench"/> to form it.

It pumps in an ocean biome with all nine blocks directly above it water. Building it on the sea floor covers both. The biome counts if either the drain or the top of the water above it is in an ocean, so a sea floor that a worldgen mod gives a cave or trench biome still works.

## <Color id="gold">Powering It</Color>

The drain needs more than 20 AP per tick (configurable). An <ItemLink id="aquatic_catalyst"/> gives:

| Fuel | AP per tick |
|---|---|
| Prismarine Crystals | 6 |
| Prismarine Shard | 12 |
| Prismarine Crystal Shard | 12 |

Two catalysts burning shards, merged in a [Laser Junction](laser_manipulation.md), give 24 and run the drain. Four are needed on Prismarine Crystals. A junction splits its power evenly between its outputs, so give it a single output toward the drain.

The beam goes in through a laser port. With the wrench, right-click the outer side of one of the four middle wall pieces (not a corner). That face becomes the port; aim your beam into it. The drain has one port at a time, and setting a new one moves it.

## <Color id="gold">Running It</Color>

Shift-right-click the drain with both hands empty to open it. It opens once it has enough power. The valve turns, then the lid swings open over a few seconds. Shift-right-click again to close it.

If it does not open, a message says how much power it is receiving against what it needs. If it opens but something will stop it pumping, such as missing water or the wrong biome, the message says that too.

While open and powered it pumps 500 mB of Salt Water every second into a 128,000 mB tank (both configurable). It is the steady source of Salt Water for the [Mixer](mixer.md), since ocean water in a Bucket stays plain water unless a pack has turned on `collectSaltWater` in `config/nautec-common.toml`.

* Take Salt Water out with a pipe on the bottom of the centre block.
* Or right-click any part of the drain with a Bucket or other fluid container. A Bucket fills once the tank holds at least 1,000 mB.

Look at a wall piece with the <ItemLink id="prism_monocle"/> to see how much fluid is stored. With Jade, looking at any part of the drain shows its state (Closed, Opening, Pumping Salt Water, Not enough power, No water above, Not in an ocean, or Tank full) and the power it receives.

<Color id="gold">Careful</Color>: an open, powered drain pulls everything above it down in a bubble column. Anything that gets into the drain takes drowning damage, dropped items included. Close it before you swim over it.
