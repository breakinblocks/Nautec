  Generators that turn the ocean into Forge Energy (FE) for other mods' machines.
</Column>

NauTec has three FE generators, one for each stage of the mod. The Tidal Rotor runs on the ocean itself, the Thermal Vent Tap boils Salt Water over the seabed's heat, and the [Fusion Plant](nautec:deep_engineering/fusion_plant.md) is the late-game reactor. Every generator pushes its FE into any cable or machine touching it.

  ### <Color id="aqua">Tidal Rotor</Color>
</Row>

A cast iron turbine for the early game, 40 to 80 FE/t with no fuel.

Place it underwater in an ocean biome. It makes 40 FE/t in the tightest spot that works and more the more open and deep the water is, reaching 80 FE/t with water on every side and 24 blocks of water above it. A rotor dug into the seabed or packed against other rotors makes less, so spread a field of them out across the ocean floor rather than stacking them.

  ### <Color id="aqua">Thermal Vent Tap</Color>
</Row>

A mid-game generator that boils Salt Water over magma or lava, 350 to 1,250 FE/t.

* **Heat.** The tap checks the nine blocks directly beneath it for Magma Blocks or lava. One hot block gives 350 FE/t, and all nine give 1,250 FE/t. A <ItemLink id="hydrothermal_vent"/> from a vent field counts as three hot blocks on its own. In the Hydrothermal Vents biome the seabed counts as three hot blocks more.
* **Fuel.** Pipe Salt Water into any side. The tap boils 10 mB every tick while it runs, so one [Deep Sea Drain](nautec:laser_chemistry/drain.md) keeps two taps going with a little to spare.
* **Salt.** Every 1,000 mB it boils leaves one <ItemLink id="salt"/> behind. Pull it out of any side with a pipe or hopper. A full slot stops the salt, not the power.
