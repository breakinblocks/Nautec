# <Color id="light_purple">Player Augmentation</Color>

<Column alignItems="center" fullWidth={true}>
  <ItemImage id="claw_robot_arm" scale="2"/>
  Your body has nine augment slots, and each slot holds one augment.
</Column>

Every augment fits only certain slots. The station screen lists the slots a part can go into when you step on it.

***

## <Color id="gold">Body Slots</Color>

| Slot | Augments that fit |
|---|---|
| Head | Vent Carapace |
| Eyes | Guardian Eye, Abyssal Eyes |
| Body | Dolphin Fin, Creative Flight (Buoyancy Tank), Photophore Skin, Vent Carapace |
| Lungs | Drowned Lung |
| Heart | Eldritch Heart, Bonus Hearts (Auxiliary Ventricle) |
| Left Arm, Right Arm | Magnet, Ender Magnet, Underwater Mining Speed, Bouncing Trident, Spreading Trident, Random Potion Throwing |
| Left Leg, Right Leg | Leap, Step Up, Prevent Fall Damage, Walking Speed |

Flight, the Dolphin Fin and Photophore Skin all need the Body slot, so you get one of the three. Vent Carapace can go in Head instead, which keeps the Body slot free.

Two copies of the same leg part do nothing more than one, so fit two different legs. The same goes for Vent Carapace in both Head and Body.

***

## <Color id="gold">Installing</Color>

Load the part and a Claw Robot Arm into one extension of a formed [Augmentation Station](augmentation_station.md), give that extension a 25 AP beam from below, then stand on the middle block, pick a slot and press Apply. The install takes four seconds, during which you cannot move.

***

## <Color id="gold">Replacing and Removing</Color>

Installing into a slot that already holds an augment replaces it. The old augment is destroyed, not returned as an item.

There is no way to take an augment out in survival other than replacing it. Operators can use `/nautec augments remove <slot>` (for example `nautec:left_arm`) or `/nautec augments clear`, which act on the player running the command.

Augments are kept when you die.

***

## <Color id="gold">Key Bindings</Color>

Most augments work on their own. These ones need a key, listed in the Controls screen under the Nautec category:

| Key (default) | Binding name | Augment |
|---|---|---|
| B | Open the Augmentation Screen | Shows your installed augments and their slots |
| L (hold) | Activate Guardian Eye Augment Laser | Guardian Eye |
| Left Alt | Leap | Leap (Hydraulic Leg) |
| Y | Throw Trident | Bouncing Trident (Trident Launcher Arm) |
| U | Throw Spreading Trident | Spreading Trident (Volley Trident Arm) |
| G | Throw Potion | Random Potion Throwing (Syringe Robot Arm) |

None of the active augments use power or items. Leap and the three throwing arms have a short cooldown between uses; the Guardian Eye fires for as long as you hold the key.
